## Limousine Commission data for Green Taxis

Data set: New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission trip records https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

The yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. Iâ€™ll use data from Green Taxis for December 2016.

Load data and analyze:
1. Characterize the data and comment about its quality
2. Explore and visualize the data e.g. a histogram of trip distance
3. Find interesting trip statistics grouped by hour
4. Build a model to understand what kind of trip yields better tips.
5. Visualize the data to help understand trip patterns

(The jupyter notebook is too large to render, please see the pdf version.)
